# Confuse Groups

Useful for practicing groups of things you confuse for each other.

## Example Data

```
One-1
Two-2
Twenty-two--22
```

*Note: separate left and right side with dash `-`. If you want to use dashes in the text itself, the separator has to be two dashes `--`.*

*Imported files and formatting (such as pictures) might contain hidden dashes. Use `--` if you're using images.*

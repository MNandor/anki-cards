# Anki Cards

A collection of my different Anki card templates.

## On Mules

You might notice I labeled some files as "mules".
This is related to what I call "mule cards".
Just like how you can make an otherwise useless account in a video game for the purpose of holding or carrying your items, you can create a useless Anki card to hold images.
You simply create the card, insert all the media you want it to hold, then suspend it.

The benefit of this is that you can refer to said media by name in other cards (even in Javascript) without having to include the media in each card individually.
